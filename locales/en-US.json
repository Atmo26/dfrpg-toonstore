You can create your characters right from our easy-to-use HTML interface, edit them right at the table, and share links with your friends and/or GM via whatever medium you like.",

As time went on though, it slowly grew in scope and complexity to encompass character hosting as well. It was originally just for my group's benefit, but since it is no more difficult to make it publicly available, I opened it up to the public. The rest, as they say, is history.",
