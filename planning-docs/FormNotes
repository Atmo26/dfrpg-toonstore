About the JSON...

Aspects
We assume that Dresden uses 7 aspects.  Other FATE games can use this Sheet with minimal alterations, so we should accomodate for those that use more (or less) Aspects.  Maybe an [Add Aspect Field] button that generates a new JSON field. Not sure if we should distinguish between the High Concept, Trouble and other Aspects.

Skills
Form should take value 'Skill cap', then generate a dictionary based on the limit. Then, provide fields to match up with the skill cap. Ex. Skill cap of Superb (+5), results in 5 fields in the skills section. [Form validation checks for number of column seperated values to make sure the Pyramid is honored?]

Stunts and Powers
Stunts and Powers are effectively the same. They each have 
⦁	Refresh Cost
⦁	Catchy Name
⦁	Description of Effect
As with Aspects, there should be a button on the form that adds a JSON form field that enables the user to enter more information dynamically. I would assume validation removes empty form fields, but I thought I would mention it.

Stress
Like Stunts and Powers, the different types of stress share certain features.
⦁	Type, a charcter string. In our game it's: Physical, Mental, Social, Resources, Hunger. Might be different in other games
⦁	Value, the number of stress boxes
⦁	Armor Value, which may be variable (Armor: 2 vs Physical or Armor: 1 vs Tabloid Journalism)
Adding additional fields dynamically is starting to sound like something we should do everywhere. Rich Vampires literally have 5 stress tracks. What if he wanted to be a Paladin to a blood god? He'd need a Devotion track too.


Consequences
Relatively simple, they have the type (as Stress) and rating (Mild, Moderate, Severe). The additional consequences will be Milds, but we may want to allow users to add larger consequences.
