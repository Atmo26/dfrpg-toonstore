	.content-block: .normalbox

		h3 The gist of it
		ul
			li We don't ask for any personal information that we don't absolutely need for the running of this site.
			li We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law.
			li We don't store your personal information unless it is required for identification purposes (e.g. an email address).
			li Any content you create through this site is publicly accessible, and immutable to anyone but you.
		p.
			The above points are detailed further below. If you have any questions about the material on this page, or would like to request
			that we delete your account and information, email us at the address given on the <a href='/site/contact'>Contact Us</a> page.

		h3 Website Visitors
		p.
			Like most websites, ToonStore collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers	and servers typically
			make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
			ToonStore's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ToonStore's visitors use its
			website. From time to time, Derogatory Studios may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
			publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
		p.
			ToonStore also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from site visitors.
			This is done to prevent abuse of server resources by blocking certain abusive IP addresses. Derogatory Studios only discloses 
			IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

		h3 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
		p.
			Certain visitors to the ToonStore website choose to interact with ToonStore in ways that require ToonStore to gather
			personally-identifying information. Users that choose to create an account allow ToonStore to store their email address
			for the duration of the account. Derogatory Studios does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
			below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
			engaging in certain website-related activities.

		h3 Aggregated Statistics
		p.
			ToonStore may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, ToonStore may monitor the popularity
			of particular character sheets. ToonStore may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ToonStore does
			not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

		h3 Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
		p.
			Derogatory Studios discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees
			that (i) need to know that information in order to properly maintain ToonStore's services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose
			it to others. Derogatory Studios will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
			anyone. Other than to its employees as described above, Derogatory Studios discloses potentially personally-identifying and
			personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Derogatory
			Studios believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Derogatory Studios,
			third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the ToonStore website and have supplied your email address,
			Derogatory Studios may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
			with whatâ€™s going on with ToonStore and related products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
			(for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
			clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Derogatory Studios takes all measures reasonably necessary to
			protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
			information.

		h3 Cookies
		p.
			A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the
			website each time the visitor returns. ToonStore uses cookies to help ToonStore identify and track visitors, their usage of the
			ToonStore website, and their website access preferences. ToonStore visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers
			should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the ToonStore websites, with the drawback that certain features of the ToonStore
			website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

		h3 Business Transfers
		p.
			If Derogatory Studios, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred
			or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Derogatory Studios may continue
			to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

		h3 Ads
		p.
			Ads appearing on any of our webpages may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the
			ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use
			your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of
			most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ToonStore and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

		h3 Site Content
		p.
			Because of the nature of the ToonStore website, all character data is publicly available for anyone that knows or can guess the link,
			including links to other characters by the same author. As such, no information put into a character sheet, including the author name,
			should be considered private. By using the ToonStore website, you agree to the above policy.

		h3 Privacy Policy Changes
		p.
			Although most changes are likely to be minor, Derogatory Studios may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Derogatory
			Studios' sole discretion. Derogatory Studios encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
			In addition, a banner will be placed on the homepage for a minimum of 30 days notifying users of a change to the privacy policy.
			Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
