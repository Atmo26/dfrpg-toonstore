		h2 Before we get started...

		p Thanks for using the ToonStore! In order to help you get up to speed, this page is designed to teach you the basics of how to navigate character sheets and get the best use out of the ToonStore. If you still have questions after reading through, join the devs and other users at the 
			a(href='https://plus.google.com/communities/100638011667854470760') Google+ group
			|  to get your questions answered. Now on to the walkthrough!

		a#management
		h2 Character Management

		p When you log in, the first thing you see is your list of characters. Each character features some basic information about the character along with a number of controls: Duplicate, Make Private/Public, and Delete. These options are only available on your own characters, with the exception of the Duplicate button. Any user may duplicate any other user's characters.

		p If a character is made private via the Make Private button, it will not appear in the character listing and be inaccessible to everyone except for the owner. Use the Make Public button to display a character again. This is a great feature for GMs that want quick access to NPCs without the player characters knowing about or seeing them.
		
		p For new users, this character listing is obviously blank. Click the "Create a new character" button at the top to make your first character. Fill out the basic information for the character where prompted, and hit Submit. If you chose a template for your character, then the character will be pre-populated with the powers and stats of that template.

		a#backseat
		h2 Viewing, Sharing, and Back-seat Mode

		p The whole point of the ToonStore is to enable easy sharing of character sheets. As such, sharing your sheet is easy. When viewing a character, just copy/paste the character link from the URL bar of your browser and send it out however you like (social media, forum post, email, etc.). This will only work for your public characters; private characters are only visible to their owners.

		.imgcontainer: img(src='/static/img/tutorial/url-bar.png')

		p People receiving your link will see a big banner at the top of the sheet saying that they are in back-seat mode. They can make changes to the sheet, but the changes are gone when the page is closed. This is useful if a player is absent from a gaming session and someone else is playing the character. They can still track stress, etc. at the table.

		p Characters also contain a link back to their owners' pages. Anyone can click this link to see other (public) characters created by the same user.

		a#optionals
		h2 Optional Components

		p Not all character sheet features are appropriate for all characters. The default look of the page mimics the published character sheets for the DFRPG, but alternatives are sometimes desirable. As such, there are a few optional features available via the Panels > Optional Panels menu.

		.imgcontainer: img(src='/static/img/tutorial/optionals.png')

		p The Notes option adds a free-form Markdown-enabled box to fill with whatever text-based data you wish. Rote spells, inventory, adventure logs, whatever you need!

		p The Shapeshifter option enables the creation of a second set of shapeshifted skills in the Skills panel. This will be addressed in the Skills section.

		a#markdown
		h2 Markdown Support

		p Many text fields in the ToonStore character sheet support Markdown, the formatting syntax used by Reddit, Github, and others. It is designed to be as intuitive and readable as possible, even in plain text. The full syntax can be found
