		h3 What is ToonStore?

		p.
			ToonStore is a place where Dresden Files RPG roleplayers can store their character sheets without
			having to worry about losing them, or destroying them, or leaving them behind. You can create your
			characters right from our easy-to-use HTML interface, edit them right at the table, and share links
			with your friends and/or DM via whatever medium you like.

		h3 How did ToonStore come to be?

		p.
			In the beginning, it was simply an effort to make a better version of the fillable character sheet
			PDF already available. As time went on though, it slowly grew in scope and complexity to encompass
			character hosting as well. It was originally just for my group's benefit, but since it is no more
			difficult to make it publicly available, I opened it up to the public. The rest, as they say, is
			history.

		h3 Who is Derogatory Studios?

		p.
			Primarily it is just me, Steven Vergenz, advised by the other members of my gaming group. I don't
			have a ton of time to work on this project though, so if you want to work on a feature for your own
			group, feel free to fork this project on <a href='https://github.com/stevenvergenz/dfrpg-toonstore' 
			target='_blank'>Github</a> for your own needs. If you do so though, I would appreciate it if you would 
			contribute your new features back to the original ToonStore project once you're done.
